The only change made to the entire project is in the OrbitsCalculator class.
The EarthRotation() method made an unecessary use of the decimal type, resulting in
severely decreased performance:

private void EarthRotation()
{
	for (decimal step = 0; step <= 360; step+=0.00005m)
	{
		EarthRotationAngle = ((double)step) * Days / EarthRotationPeriod;
	}
    Update("EarthRotationAngle");
}

The type of the 'step' variable has been set to float which greatly improved performance
and at the same time preserved functionality:

private void EarthRotation()
{
	for (float step = 0; step <= 360; step+=0.00005f)
	{
		EarthRotationAngle = (step) * Days / EarthRotationPeriod;
	}
    Update("EarthRotationAngle");
}

You can find screenshots of the performed before/after tests in the PerformanceTestImages
folder.
