1. Create a structure Point3D to hold a 3D-coordinate {X, Y, Z} in the Euclidian 3D space. 
   Implement the ToString() to enable printing a 3D point.
2. Add a private static read-only field to hold the start of the coordinate system – the point O{0, 0, 0}.
   Add a static property to return the point O.
3. Write a static class with a static method to calculate the distance between two points in the 3D space.
4. Create a class Path to hold a sequence of points in the 3D space. Create a static class PathStorage with
   static methods to save and load paths from a text file. Use a file format of your choice.
